# /'ArduinoExample'
This folder contains a simple application example of using the CenyML library in an Arduino UNO to train a linear regression model, make predictions and apply a validation code for it.

# How to explore the CenyML project files.
The following will describe the general purpose of the folders that are located in the current directory address:

- **/CenyML_Library/**:
    - This folder will contain all the CenyML library files, along with their respective documentation (in the form of comments just before the code of each function begins).

# How to excecute this program
It is really simple to use this program. All you have to do is to open the "ArduinoExample.ino" file with the Arduino IDE, which you must have already installed in your computer system. Then, use the "Tool" menu bar to configure your particular Arduino device so that you then click in the upload button. Finally, after having uploaded the code into your Arduino, click the "Serial Monitor" button and there, you will see several messages that will inform you about the progress of the program and its results obtained. Have fun!.
