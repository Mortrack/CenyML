# /'Arduino\_Example'
This folder contains all the available application examples of using the CenyML library in an Arduino UNO to train a machine learning model; make predictions and; in some cases, apply a validation code for it.

# How to explore the CenyML project files.
The following will describe the general purpose of the folders that are located in the current directory address:

- **/simpleLinearRegression/**:
    - This folder will contain all files that were used to develop the application example to use the get function of the simple linear regression method from the CenyML to implement it in an Arduino UNO embedded system.

# How to excecute this program
It is really simple to use this program. All you have to do is to open the folder corresponding to the method you have interest in and then open the "ArduinoExample.ino" file with the Arduino IDE, which you must have already installed in your computer system. Then, use the "Tool" menu bar to configure your particular Arduino device so that you then click in the upload button. Finally, after having uploaded the code into your Arduino, click the "Serial Monitor" button and there, you will see several messages that will inform you about the progress of the program and its results obtained. Have fun!.
