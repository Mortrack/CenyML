# CenyML
Inspired in the "Mortrack_ML_Library", CenyML provides a Machine Learning library and API programmed in C that was created by CÃ©sar Miranda Meza in his master's degree at IPN (CITEDI) and was completed on MONTH DAY, 2022. This software contributes with a complete and additional set of machine learning tools that have the philosophy of increasing performance to the maximum and having transparent output models and documentation. As a result, through a personal code tailored by the user, it will be possible to apply a resulting model from CenyML even without using neither the library nor the API provided. In addition, the user has the option of using CenyML through its software library or in its API format, depending on his needs. For example, the API could be used to train a certain model on a remote high performance server. Subsequently, the generated model could be implemented in a low cost microcontroller/microprocessor or embedded system through its library format (e.g., Arduino or literally any microcontroller you can think of that has enough memory to store either the whole library or the particular method required from it).
