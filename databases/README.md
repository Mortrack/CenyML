# /'databases/'
This folder contains all the databases that were created in order to test and validate each of the developed CenyML functions, along with the documentation of such databases.

# How to explore the CenyML project files.
The following will describe the general purpose of the folders that are located in the current directory address:

- **/classification/**:
    - This folder will contain all files that were used and created in order to make all the databases that were used to test and validate each of the classification algorithms that were developed in the CenyML library. In addition, you will also be able to find the technical documentation for each of the generated databases, which will available in several different .pdf files.
- **/regression/**:
    - This folder will contain all files that were used and created in order to make all the databases that were used to test and validate each of the regression algorithms that were developed in the CenyML library. In addition, you will also be able to find the technical documentation for each of the generated databases, which will available in several different .pdf files.
